## About SWAPI
With SWAPI you can fetch all kinds of data from the star wars movies. And see what characters are connected to what plant/movie/vehicle.

## API limit
SWAPI has a limit of 10.000 API requests per day, should be enough for the average star wars fan right?
There is no API limit needed.

  * In the catogories you can click on an item and see further details of that item.
